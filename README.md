# Main Code for Word Clock

WordClock contains the main code

WordClockTest contains some code that was used to try out the various features of the electronics. It is not guaranteed to work as expected.

This code is designed to work specifically with the electronics setup. The HEX codes that refer to each word sinks an entire row. That is why it can be so compact.

Please see https://github.com/madebyjoe/WordClockPCB for the electronics setup.
